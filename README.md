# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### **Overview**

This analysis identifies employees who are reaching retirement age, by job title.  It also identifies who will be eligible for a mentorship program that is being developed to prepare the next generation of leaders.


### **Results**

* 90,398 employees are eligible for retirement, which presents ~30% of the company’s workforce

* Approximately 64% of employees who are eligible to retire are Senior Engineers (approx. 33%) and Senior Staff (approx. 31%)

*	There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program, which represents only 1.7% of the population that is eligible to retire

*	Business continuity will be partially dependent on three key factors:
    1. Staggering or delaying retirements, which could require an investment in retention bonuses

    2. The success of the proposed mentorship program

    3. An aggressive external recruitment strategy

### **Summary**

If the company maintains its current operating structure, it will need to replace 90,398 employees as the “silver tsunami” comes to life.  There are enough retirement eligible employees to mentor the 1,549 who are eligible for the mentorship program.  However, that program will not be sufficient to address the future workforce needs.
